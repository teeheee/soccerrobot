Version 1.0 is the current used version. It has major errors which need to be fixed after etching (mirrord components)

Version 1.1 is the corrected version. I didn't have time to fix it so be aware of more errors.

IMPORTANT:

	Dont forget to disconnect the onboard 3,3V Voltage generator of your teensy!



TODO

this board fries a teensy occasionally (3 for 2 Robots over a Year). If you know why please tell me!!! -> alexander.ulbrich@uni-ulm.de
